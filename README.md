# Nothing but NumPy

This open source repository is part of a series of blog posts titled _"Nothing but NumPy"_, that aims to explain all the nuts
and bolts that go in to making an artificial neural network and creating them using only [NumPy](https://numpy.org/).


## [1. Understanding and Creating Neural Networks](/Understanding_and_Creating_NNs)

_Part of the a blog post ["Nothing but NumPy: Understanding &amp; Creating Neural Networks with Computational Graphs from Scratch"](https://medium.com/@rafayak/nothing-but-numpy-understanding-creating-neural-networks-with-computational-graphs-from-scratch-6299901091b0)_

Introudces the concept of an "artifical neural network" laying down the foundation for future installments.


## [2. Understanding and Creating Binary Classification Neural Networks](/Understanding_and_Creating_Binary_Classifaication_NNs)
_Part of the a blog post ["Nothing but NumPy: Understanding &amp; Creating Binary Classification Neural Networks with Computational Graphs from Scratch"](https://medium.com/@rafayak/nothing-but-numpy-understanding-creating-binary-classification-neural-networks-with-e746423c8d5c)_


This second installment of _"Nothing but NumPy"_ builds upon the previous post. It delves into creating a neural network to solve a
specific kind of problem called _"binary classification"_.
